# Shifts the expression of each gene, so that the mean expression across cells is 0
# Scales the expression of each gene, so that the variance across cells is 1
# This step gives equal weight in downstream analyses, so that highly-expressed genes do not dominate
# The results of this are stored in pbmc[["RNA"]]$scale.data
# By default, only variable features are scaled.
